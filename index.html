		<h1>The Manatee Frank</h1>

		<b>Welcome to this website about this Manatee called Frank!</b>

		<p>
			Manatees, also known as sea cows, are herbivorous marine mammals that are found in warm waters around the world, including in Florida where Frank lives.
		</p>

		<p>
			The average lifespan of a manatee is around 40 years in the wild, although some individuals have been known to live up to 60 years.
		</p>

		<p>
			Manatees are known for their large, plump bodies, which can weigh up to 1,000 pounds or more. Frank is likely a male manatee, as they tend to be larger than females.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Manatees have a slow metabolism and a low body temperature, which means they can only tolerate water temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This is one of the reasons why they are often found in warm, shallow waters.	
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Manatees are gentle creatures that spend most of their time grazing on sea grass and other aquatic plants. They have no natural predators, but are threatened by human activities such as boat strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat destruction. As a beloved member of his local community, Frank likely benefits from the protection and conservation efforts of those who care for him.
